# emt-cpp

The web application for the EMT or Event Management Tool. Using
the [Drogon web framework](https://github.com/an-tao/drogon), it is intended to work in tandem with the EMT Discord Bot
and EMT IPS application by using the data collected by the bot to provide event attendance data as well as the IPS
application to link IPS calendar events to events which can be hosted by this tool.
